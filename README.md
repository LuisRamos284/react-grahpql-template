```

## Dependencies

To install the Hasura-cli follow this link : https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html

## Start Up

Simply run:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start:docker
$ yarn start:hasura
$ yarn start:app
```

## Notes

*   There is an issue using workspaces with yarn 1.2.* the recommended version is 1.19.1 or use yarn2
*   You should store your HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET in another file, this is just an example and could lead to security issues
*   You should create an USER and ROLES in the Database (you can use MySQL too if you want)
*   This template is just a starting point, you SHOULD change the hardcoded HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET and implement sign in, sign out, auth... services
*   The `config.yaml` file inside  `hasura/` should be pointing to our test/staging environment. To get the console up and running just do the following: `yarn start:hasura`
